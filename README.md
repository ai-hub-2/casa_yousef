# Sky CASA - Medical Laboratory Analysis System

## Overview
Sky CASA is a medical laboratory analysis application designed for processing and analyzing various types of medical tests including CBC (Complete Blood Count), urinalysis, stool analysis, and more.

## Recent Fix: Case Limit Issue
This version includes a fix for the "cannot add more than 10 cases" issue:

### Problem
Users reported that they could not add or view more than 10 cases in the application, even though the database was capable of storing more records.

### Root Cause
The issue was identified as a UI display limitation, not a storage limitation:
- The database (SQLite) can store unlimited records
- The application business logic does not limit case creation
- The UI was using `GetSampleData()` methods with a default limit of 10 records
- This created the illusion of a 10-case limit

### Solution Implemented
Enhanced the DataAccessLayer with a new method that retrieves all records without limits:

1. Added `GetAllData()` method to both C# and VB versions of DataAccessLayer
2. Created UI update guide and automation tools
3. Provided comprehensive verification tools

### Files Modified
- `DataAccessLayer.cs` - Added GetAllData method
- `DataAccessLayer.vb` - Added GetAllData method

### Files Created
- `UI_UPDATE_GUIDE.txt` - Instructions for updating UI code
- `UpdateUIDataAccess.ps1` - PowerShell script to automate UI updates
- `RunUIUpdate.bat` - Batch file to run the PowerShell script
- `VerifyCaseLimitFix.cs` - Comprehensive verification tool
- `RunVerification.bat` - Batch file to compile and run verification
- `COMPLETE_CASE_LIMIT_FIX_GUIDE.txt` - Complete guide explaining the fix

## How to Apply the Fix
1. Run `RunUIUpdate.bat` to automatically update UI code to use `GetAllData()` instead of `GetSampleData()`
2. Or manually update UI forms by replacing calls to `GetSampleData("table_name", 10)` with `GetAllData("table_name")`
3. For large datasets, consider implementing pagination for better performance

## Database
The application uses SQLite for local data storage with the following tables:
- sem, ret, stool, urine, cbc, vis, dr, path, log, admin

## Dependencies
- AForge.NET libraries for image processing
- Firebird SQL Client for database operations
- System.Data.SQLite for SQLite database access

## Running the Application
Execute `Run_Sky_CASA.bat` to start the application.

## Verification
Run `RunVerification.bat` to verify that the case limit fix is working correctly.
